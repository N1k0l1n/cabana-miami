    "Description": "Recycled wood benches are environmentally friendly seating options crafted from reclaimed and repurposed wood materials. These benches are made from salvaged wood obtained from various sources like old furniture, demolished buildings, shipping pallets, or discarded lumber. The wood varies in type, including oak, pine, cedar, or teak, contributing to a diverse aesthetic. These benches feature a rustic or weathered appearance, showcasing the natural wear, patina, and unique imperfections of the reclaimed wood. Some have visible marks, knots, nail holes, or grain patterns that add to their charm and individuality. Artisans skillfully repurposed the reclaimed wood, shaping it into bench components like seat planks, backrests, and legs. The construction involves sanding, planing, or leaving the wood in a more raw and natural state to maintain its original character. These benches come in various styles and sizes, catering to different tastes and needs. Some have simple, clean lines for a modern aesthetic, while others may feature intricate designs or carvings that highlight the wood's history. One of the key aspects of recycled wood benches is their positive environmental impact. By utilizing reclaimed wood, these benches contribute to reducing deforestation, minimizing waste, and promoting sustainability by giving new life to discarded materials.

    "Description": "Recycled wood benches are environmentally friendly seating options crafted from reclaimed or repurposed wood materials. These benches are made from salvaged wood obtained from various sources like old furniture, demolished buildings, shipping pallets, or discarded lumber. The wood varies in type, including oak, pine, cedar, or teak, contributing to a diverse aesthetic. These benches feature a rustic or weathered appearance, showcasing the natural wear, patina, and unique imperfections of the reclaimed wood. Some have visible marks, knots, nail holes, or grain patterns that add to their charm and individuality. Artisans skillfully repurposed the reclaimed wood, shaping it into bench components like seat planks, backrests, and legs. The construction involves sanding, planing, or leaving the wood in a more raw and natural state to maintain its original character. These benches come in various styles and sizes, catering to different tastes and needs. Some have simple, clean lines for a modern aesthetic, while others may feature intricate designs or carvings that highlight the wood's history. One of the key aspects of recycled wood benches is their positive environmental impact. By utilizing reclaimed wood, these benches contribute to reducing deforestation, minimizing waste, and promoting sustainability by giving new life to discarded materials .Recycled wood benches are versatile and can be used in outdoor spaces like gardens, parks, or patio areas, as well as indoor settings such as entryways, living rooms, or dining areas, adding character and a sense of history to the space.\n\\n\n\\nDimensions:30cmX30cmX45cm\n\\nDimensions:75cmX30cmX45cm\n\\nDimensions:100cmX30cmX45cm",

The use of thin boards adds a sense of depth and texture to the ceiling, giving it a charming and rustic look.Teak oil is applied as a finishing treatment to these boards. Teak oil is a popular choice for wood finishing due to its ability to enhance the natural grain and color of the wood while providing a protective layer. It deepens the tones of the wood, enriching its appearance and providing a warm and lustrous finish.When applied to the thin wooden boards used for ceiling coverings, teak oil not only protects the wood but also brings out its natural beauty. It can highlight the variations in the wood grain, creating a visually appealing pattern across the ceiling\n\\n\n\\nDimensions:100cmX100cmX6cm.",

Rattan, derived from the rattan palm, is a durable and flexible material that is intricately woven to form a ceiling covering. It is known for its strength, lightweight nature, and ability to withstand various weather conditions.This ceiling covering, designed to add a modern touch to outdoor settings, features a woven rattan construction that allows diffused light to pass through, creating a pleasant ambiance. The natural look and texture of rattan contribute to a warm and inviting atmosphere, complementing different architectural styles and outdoor decors.However, it's important to note that without a rain cover or proper protection from the elements, this type of ceiling covering might not be suitable for extended exposure to rain or harsh weather conditions. Rattan, although durable, can be affected by excessive moisture, potentially leading to deterioration or damage over time. Therefore, it's recommended to use a rain cover or shelter to preserve the quality and longevity of the rattan ceiling covering when installed outdoors.\n\\n\n\\nDimensions:200cmX100cmX7cm",

    "Description": "Our baskets are crafted from teak wood, a durable and high-quality hardwood known for its strength, resilience, and attractive grain patterns. These baskets are handmade by skilled artisans who carve, shape, and assemble teak wood into functional and decorative storage solutions. Teak is revered for its natural resistance to moisture, decay, and insects, making it an excellent choice for durable, long-lasting products. Artisans carefully carve and shape teak wood into thin strips or panels, which are then interwoven or assembled using traditional woodworking techniques. The baskets come in various shapes and sizes. These baskets serve multiple purposes, including storing fruits, vegetables, bread, towels, magazines, or other household items. They can be used in kitchens, living rooms, bedrooms, or even outdoors, adding a touch of natural elegance to the decor. Due to teak wood's inherent strength and resistance to various environmental conditions, these baskets are durable and can withstand regular use for many years.\n\\n\n\\nDimensions:100cmX100cmX65cm",
